# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to identify the amount of employees who have reached retirement age, as well as how many employees would be eligable for a mentorship program, in order to prepare of the possible 'Silver Tsunami' of retiring employees and to prepare for the future of the company.


### Results

The takeaways from this analysis are as follows:
- There is a staggering number of employees eligible for retiement; 33,118 to be exact, which would create the 'silver tsunami'.
- In order to ease with the transition once these employees do start retiring we will need to replace most of those 33 thousand positions, which can be helped with the creation of a mentorship program, which involves our more senior employees, who are not yet at retirement age.

- The title with the most eligible retirees is the software engineer position with 25,000.
- The title with the least amount of eligible retirees is the assistant engineer position with 1000.

### Summary

There are currently 33,118 emmployees eligible for retirement, out of a total of 300,000. This means that 11% of Pewlett Hackards workforce could retire soon leading to a 'silver tsunami'. Below is the amount of retirement eligible employees sorted by their titles. The most urgent field that would need to start being replaced after retirement is the engineering field.
With the creation of a mentorship program, taking into account the seniority of employees who are not yet eligible for retirement, we are left with 1,549 individuals who would be able to assist in the mentoring of less senior employees as well as new hires to backfill all 33,000 retirees as they leave the workforce.

For having 33,000 employees ready to retire, the number of employees who can participate in the mentorship seems low, at 1549. This would leave to each employee having to mentor 21 others to keep up with the loss of retired employees. However, we have to take into account that not every employee is going to retire at the same time, so this gives the mentoring employee more space in between mentoring and a varying degree of individuals they would have to train at that time.
